# ww-vc-trio
[![Project Status: Experimental – Useable, some support, not open to feedback, unstable API.](https://getwilds.org/badges/badges/experimental.svg)](https://getwilds.org/badges/#experimental)

This WILDS WDL workflow takes samples through a standard alignment protocol and identifies variants using a trio of well-established variant callers. Finally, the workflow narrows it down to variants of confidence by analyzing consensus amongst the three variant callers.

## Usage

For Fred Hutch users that are new to WDL, we recommend using [PROOF](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/dasldemos/proof-how-to/) to submit this workflow directly to the on-premise HPC cluster, as it simplifies interaction with Cromwell and provides a user-friendly front-end for job submission and tracking. For users outside of Fred Hutch or more advanced users who would like to run the workflow locally, command line execution is relatively straightforward: 
```
java -jar cromwell-86.jar run ww-vc-trio.wdl \
    --inputs ww-vc-trio-inputs.json \
    --options ww-vc-trio-options.json
```
Although Cromwell is demonstrated here, this pipeline is not specific to Cromwell and can be run using whichever WDL execution method you prefer ([miniwdl](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl), [Terra](https://terra.bio/), [HealthOmics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/workflows.html), etc.).
